### Chatbot called Milliam Wicaskall that answers questions about Effective Altruism

1. Add to Google Drive (to your root folder or you'll have to change your path in the code): https://drive.google.com/drive
2. Open the ipynb in Google Colab (right click > Open With > Google Colaboratory or Add more extensions if it doesnt appear).

Then just execute the code blocks with shft+enter. Some things download into Google cloud server (it doesn't download to your local computer) the first time you run it.

It's still a work in progress. Feel free to share and have others interested reach out if they'd like or just do their own thing with the code. It should be trained with more data or different models could be used, which should be simple and we've left tips for how to expand it at the bottom of the code: https://github.com/danielmlow/effective_altruism_chatbot/blob/main/ea_chatbot.ipynb 

Free to use and reproduce.
